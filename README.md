# Battleship

Full-stack app built with Express, React, and Redux to render the Battleship game.

## Overview
This app is modeled after the classic game Battleship. In this app, the user must register or sign in to their account in order to begin the game. For a new game, the user will be instructed to place their ships, with the ability to toggle vertical and horizontal alignment. Once the user is satisfied with their placement, they may begin a new game. The user will be playing against AI and will be able to save their game. If the user wants to return to a previously saved game, they only need to click the load game button. The user will also have their number of wins and losses saved to their profile.
