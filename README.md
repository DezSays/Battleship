# Battleship

Full-stack app built with Express, React, and Redux.

## Overview
This app is modeled after the classic game, Battleship. In this app, a user must register or sign in to their account in order to begin a game. For a new game, the user is instructed to place their ships, with the ability to toggle vertical and horizontal alignment. Once the user is satisfied with their placement, they may begin a new game. The user plays against AI and has the ability to save their game. If the user wants to return to a previously saved game, they can click the "Load Game" button. Wins and losses are saved to the user's profile.
